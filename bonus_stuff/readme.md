# Bonus Goodies

Here you will find various folders with code that might be helpful for your projects. Remember, these are templates and you will need to change the parameters to suit your specific data and project goals.

### Pipelines
* RNA-Seq processing (including DNMT expression)
* SNP calling

### Extra staff for DNA methylation
* Alternate reference genomes (incorporating SNPs)
This script takes a reference genome and substitutes SNPs of an individual into it. This helps with accurate methylation calling.
* Blast to identify DNMTs and TET
This script will show you how to identify DNMTs/TET if you're working with a non-model organism.
